# What Type?

## About
What Type is a software development project about understading what are all pokemon from certain types.

### What are Pokemon types?
Pokemon types can be defined as a macro group that a pokemon can fit it. For example, fish pokemon can be defined, generally, as Water type pokemon.

### Why are Pokemon types important?
A Pokemon's type say a lot about them. It directly influences which moves it learn, which are their weaknesses and resistences and how much damage their attacks cause.

## Technical Documentation
In this section, we can understand a little bit better about the technical documentation from the What Type project.

### Main Technologies
The Project is built on top of the Angular Framework, which is a front-end development framework that uses typescript as the main programming language.
The Angular framework also supports normal HTML and CSS page creation, but with some changes. Angular has specific commands that can interact with html code. This creates a bridge between typescript and html script. This is a huge step towards creating advanced logic for web pages, since html is very limited in terms of creating advanced logical programming.

#### Typescript
Typescript is an extension from Javascript that uses strongly typed variabled instead of "duck type" variables. These are very important for code readability, since their behavior is predictable. Without strongly typed variables, a function argument, return type or local variable can assume any type depending on the implementation, which is a nightmare for API consumers.
